# oVirt Node discovery image

This page describes how to download, build and configure discovery image.

# Building the Discovery PXE Image

The process is described on a [separate wiki
page](extra/ovirt-node-plugin-foreman/README.md).

# Downloading existing Discovery PXE Image

*Alpha version* of Foreman Discovery image (0.1.0) are [available for
download] (http://lzap.fedorapeople.org/zzz/). These images were build in the
production mode - root account is locked.

We provide both ISO file which can be used for injection of modified Discovery
plugin or even other oVirt Node plugins, and extracted kernel and initrd.

To setup kernel and initial RAM disk on a TFTP server do something like:

    cd /var/lib/tftpboot/boot
    wget http://lzap.fedorapeople.org/zzz/discovery-prod-0.3.0-1-initrd.img
    wget http://lzap.fedorapeople.org/zzz/discovery-prod-0.3.0-1-vmlinuz

Check permissions and ownership after that.

# Configuration

## PXE config

To configure discovery booting modify provisioning template named "PXE Default
File":

    DEFAULT menu
    PROMPT 0
    MENU TITLE PXE Menu
    TIMEOUT 200
    TOTALTIMEOUT 6000
    ONTIMEOUT discovery

    LABEL discovery
    MENU LABEL Foreman Discovery
    KERNEL boot/discovery-vmlinuz
    APPEND rootflags=loop initrd=boot/discovery-initrd.img root=live:/foreman.iso rootfstype=auto ro rd.live.image rd.live.check rd.lvm=0 rootflags=ro crashkernel=128M elevator=deadline max_loop=256 rd.luks=0 rd.md=0 rd.dm=0 foreman.url=https://foreman.domain.lan nomodeset selinux=0 stateless

Note the long line and selinux is disabled for oVirt Node image. Also do not
forget to press "Build PXE Default" button afterwards.

There are several ways of configuring Foreman URL to be used for facts upload:

 * foreman.url - specify URL of the foreman service. When using names, make sure
   it does resolve correctly. Note the difference between http and https protocol
   schemes. You may optionally specify port.
 * foreman.server - specify hostname of the foreman (http scheme is used)
 * foreman.ip - specify ip address of the foreman (http scheme is used)
 * Nothing is provided - DNS SRV record with name `_foreman._tcp.domain.` is being
   queried to determine hostname and port of the service.

To configure the SRV entry with ISC BIND do something like:

    _x-foreman._tcp.virtual.lan. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 443 foreman.virtual.lan.

When port number 443 is specified, https scheme will be used, http otherwise.
Also make sure that DHCP returns valid search domain, otherwise the SRV entry
will not be found by the discovered node.

# Known Issues with the image

## Unable to login on the running image

Root account and ssh are disabled on production images, to get a shell you
need to build your own image (see above) and provide debug option there.

# More configuration

Some configuration needs to be done in Foreman - go back to the [discovery
readme](README.md) to find out more.
